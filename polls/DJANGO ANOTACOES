DJANGO ANOTACOES



Creating a project
If this is your first time using Django, you’ll have to take care of some initial setup. Namely, you’ll need to auto-generate some code that establishes a Django project – a collection of settings for an instance of Django, including database configuration, Django-specific options and application-specific settings.

From the command line, cd into a directory where you’d like to store your code, then run the following command:

	django-admin startproject mysite


The development server
Let’s verify your Django project works. Change into the outer mysite directory, if you haven’t already, and run the following commands: {

	python manage.py runserver
}


Creating the Polls app
To create your app, make sure you’re in the same directory as manage.py and type this command:
	
	python manage.py startapp polls
